This demo contains the sampling schemes with number of samples 28x3 and 90x3 by various methods used in Table 1 and Figure 1 in paper [1]
Please run Show_Table1_Figure1.m to reproduce Table 1 and Fig. 1 in [1]. 
If you use the proposed method or sampling schemes provided in this demo, please cite the paper [1]. 

1. "Designing Single- and Multiple-Shell Sampling Schemes for Diffusion MRI Using Spherical Code", Jian Cheng, Dinggang Shen, Pew-Thian Yap, MICCAI 2014. 


Note: 
1. The schemes with numbers of 28x3 and 90x3 by incremental generalized Electrostatic Energy Minimization (gEEM) were downloaded from 
http://www.emmanuelcaruyer.com/q-space-sampling.php
2. The covering radius of the scheme with number 28x3 by gEEM was extracted from the paper 
"Design of Multishell Sampling Schemes with Uniform Coverage in Diffusion MRI",  but the schemes with number 28x3 and 90x3 are not publicly available. 
3. Single shell schemes by EEM (Elec028.txt, Elec084.txt, Elec090.txt) are from CAMONO. 
http://sourceforge.net/p/camino/code/ci/master/tree/PointSets/
However the scheme with 270 samples by EEM is not available in CAMINO.
