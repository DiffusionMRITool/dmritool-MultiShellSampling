1. [Single- and Multiple-Shell Uniform Sampling Schemes for Diffusion MRI Using Spherical Codes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06682.pdf), Jian Cheng, Dinggang Shen, Pew-Thian Yap, Peter J. Basser, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI), 2017. 

The files include the sampling schemes generated by different methods and some matlab codes to reproduce the results in the paper. You can run `demo_Figure2.m` in matlab to reproduce Fig.2 in the paper. 

For more demos and reproducible results, please see [this tutorial](https://diffusionmritool.github.io/tutorial_qspacesampling.html).
