1. "Novel Single and Multiple Shell Uniform Sampling  Schemes for Diffusion MRI Using Spherical Codes", Jian Cheng, Dinggang Shen, Pew-Thian Yap, Peter J. Basser, MICCAI 2015. 

The files include the sampling schemes generated by different methods and some matlab codes to reproduce the results in the paper. 
You can run demo_Table1.m and demo_Figure1.m in matlab to reproduce Fig.1 and Table 1 in the paper. 


Sampling schemes description:

  * reference_EEM_CAMINO:  It contains single shell best known sampling schemes extracted from CAMINO (http://sourceforge.net/p/camino/code/ci/master/tree/PointSets/). 
                           They are generated by EEM method, which takes hours or days to minimize electrostatic energy. 

  * multishells:           It contains multi-shell schemes generated by different methods. 

  * singleshell:           It contains single-shell schemes generated by incremental methods (IEEM, ISC, IMOC) using different uniform tessellation samples. 
                           t3 means tessellation order 3 with 81 samples, and t7 means tessellation order 7 with 20481 samples. 
  
Code description:

  * demo_Table1.m :                 Reproduce table 1 in the paper. 
  * demo_Figure1.m :                Reproduce figure 1 in the paper.
